# Quickstart

Run `cargo run --release --bin=compress data/cogsci/nuts-bolts.json --max-arity=2 --iterations=3`

In around 10 seconds this should produce an output like

```

Brief guide to reading this:
- `inv0` is the autogenerated name of the invention
- `(1.78x wrt orig)` means the resulting compressed programs using `inv0` were 1.78x smaller than the original programs
- `utility: 836528` this is a measure of how many much smaller the program got after rewriting it in terms of the new primitives (divide by 100 to get appx how  many fewer leaf nodes are in the rewritten program)
- `uses: 320` the invention was useful in 320 places in the set of programs
- Note that in these inventions `#i` is used for invention variables and `$i` for original program variables.
