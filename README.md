# Quickstart

Run `cargo run --release --bin=compress data/cogsci/nuts-bolts.json --compress-max-arity=2 --iterations=3`

In around 10 seconds this should produce an output like

```

Brief guide to reading this:
- `inv0` is the autogenerated name of the invention
- `(1.78x wrt orig)` means the resulting compressed programs using `inv0` were 1.78x smaller than the original programs
- `utility: 840320` this is a measure of how many much smaller the program got - if you divide the utility by 100 you get approximately the decrease in the number of primitives that comes from using this invention.
- `uses: 320` the invention was useful in 320 places in the set of programs
- Note that in these inventions `#i` is used for invention variables and `$i` for original program variables.
